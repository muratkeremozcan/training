        response.status(404).json('No description found for ' + request.params.name); // use the status function to set it to 404 Not found status code. Respond with a custon JSON error message
    } else { // when we have a description go here
        response.json(description); //  responding with description and proper status code, defaults to 200 success status code, the APP.PARAM function maps palceholders to callback functions. Useful for runnign pre-conditions on dynamic routes

// to run it do curl http://localhost:3000/blocks/Fixed, http://localhost:3000/blocks/Movable
// now even  fixed  and movable  or camelCase works!
